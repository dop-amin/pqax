/**
 * For a given leaf index, computes the authentication path and the resulting
 * root node using Merkle's TreeHash algorithm.
 * Expects the layer and tree parts of the tree_addr to be set, as well as the
 * tree type (i.e. SPX_ADDR_TYPE_HASHTREE or SPX_ADDR_TYPE_FORSTREE).
 * Applies the offset idx_offset to indices before building addresses, so that
 * it is possible to continue counting indices across trees.

 * This implementation computes on N internal nodes at a time (in
